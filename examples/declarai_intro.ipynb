        "Declarai turns your Python code into LLM tasks, allowing you to easily integrate LLM into your existing codebase. It operates on a simple principle: just define a Python function/class. By annotating this function with docstrings and type hints, you provide a clear instruction set for the AI model without any additional effort.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you've declared your function, Declarai intelligently compiles the function's docstrings and type hints into a prompt for the AI model, ensuring the model understands exactly what's required.\n",
        "\n",
        "After executing the task, Declarai retrieves the AI's response and parses it, translating it back into the declared return type of your Python function. This eliminates any manual parsing or post-processing on your part.\n",

        "Declarai Keeps It Native: At its core, Declarai is about embracing native Python practices. You don't need to learn a new syntax or adapt to a different coding paradigm. Just write Python functions as you always have, and let Declarai handle the AI integration seamlessly."
