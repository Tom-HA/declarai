# Tutorial - User Guide

<br>
The tutorial is a step-by-step guide to using **Declarai**. It walks you through the main features of Declarai.

Each section gradually builds on the previous ones, but it's structured to separate topics, so that you can go directly
to any specific one to solve your specific task needs.

It is also built to work as a future reference.

So you can come back and see exactly what you need.

## Run the code

All the code blocks can be copied and ran directly in your Python environment.
To run them just copy the code to a file main.py and run it with

```bash
$ python main.py
```

Do your best to copy, run and edit the code in your editor to really understand how powerful Declarai
is.

## Install Declarai

For this tutorial, we use the `openai` provider, which is the default provider in Declarai.

To install it Declarai with the `openai` provider, run the following command:
<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install declarai[openai]

---> 100%
Done!
```

</div>

In case you are using a different provider, you can install it by replacing `openai` with the `provider name`, or
install
all the available providers by running the following command:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ pip install declarai[all]
---> 100%
Done!
```

</div>

## Advanced User Guide

There is also an **Advanced User Guide** that covers more advanced topics.
The advanced guide is built on the same concepts as the tutorial, but it dives deeper into the things you can do with
Declarai.

We recommend you to read the tutorial first, and then the advanced guide if you want to learn more.
